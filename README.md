Contacts Assistant is an APP like(and based on) iOS Contacts, but more powerful.
You CAN
- Send group messages and emails 
- Use tag to organise contacts (very useful when send group sms and email)
- scan QR Code to add new person (the QR Code must be generated by Contacts Assistant)
- Add Event to reminder you to contact someone
- Create Relations in people, and you will see someone's relation in a "map"


Next:

- Refactoring. I found the current code is so ugly when I read some beautiful one and known some more advanced notion and practice. 
- Deliver it to US.
